                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Originally laid out by Peter Klein in 1760, the town was first named 'Petersburg'. German settlers in the area came to call the town 'Kleine Stedtle'. As confusion between the town and a neighboring town (also named 'Petersburg', now York Springs) grew, the town officially changed its name to Littlestown (essentially a translation of 'Kleine Stedtle' from German) in 1795.</p>
