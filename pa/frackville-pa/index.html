            <p>Frackville was settled in 1861. It was incorporated more than a decade later in 1876, when the villages of Frackville and Mountain City merged to form the borough of Frackville. The name 'Mountain City', however, is still a common nickname for the borough. A past diner and beer distributor were both named after it.</p>
