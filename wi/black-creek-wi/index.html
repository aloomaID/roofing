            <h3>Black Creek, WI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Black Creek is a village in north-central Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,357 at the 2020 census. The village is located within the Town of Black Creek, but is governed independently. Origins of the community trace back to 1862 when it was settled by American Civil War veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham. Initially, the village had been referred to as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to Green Bay, Shawano, and Appleton. However, the name was later changed to reflect the dark-colored creek along the outskirts of the community following village incorporation in 1904. Today, Black Creek hosts a variety of community events including the annual Family Daze celebration.</p>
